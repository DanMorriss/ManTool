# Project Description
This is MenTool, just a simple way of tracking your mood whenever you want to.
It’s completely anonymous, all data here is just for you to see how you’re getting on.
At MenTool we understand that sharing moods and feelings with others can be difficult so we’re
providing users with a way of simply recording them. You can then view the data and see how things
are changing, for better or worse, over time.
This might help you become more aware of how you are feeling about yourself, relationships, the wider
world and more or it might just be an interesting thing to look at - ‘This week I was OK for more
days than I was sad’ or ‘That was a great week, only one down day!”.
We’re not going to suggest changes, hint at trends or anything else, just allow you to observe how
you feel day by day. It’s so easy to use, just a couple of clicks a day or whenever you want too.

## Colour
This colour palette combines deep navy blue (#010A26), dark teal (#224040), soft off-white (#EBF2F2), olive green (#595542), and light taupe (#BFBAAA) to create a harmonious and balanced aesthetic.  We chose these calm, earthly colours to reflect the app's purpose of tracking and reflecting on emotional states.

## Fonts
Audiowide, with its modern and tech-forward appearance, was used for headings to give the app a contemporary and professional look. In contrast, Quicksand, with its more approachable and readable style, was applied for body text, ensuring that longer texts are easy on the eyes and pleasant to read. The combination of these two fonts balances a modern, tech-forward look with approachability and ease of use, aligning well with the app’s purpose and its target user base.

***

After cloning or opening the repository in Gitpod, you will need to:

1. Create your own `.env` file in the root level of the project:

```
SECRET_KEY=[your_secret_key]
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=postgres://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database_name]
CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://[api_key]:[api_secret]@[cloud_name]
```
**Ensure the `.env` file is added to your `.gitignore` file so it doesn't get pushed to a public repository.

If you don't have a Cloudinary account already, you will need to [Sign Up for Free](https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free) to host the static files in the project.

2. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install required Python packages.

3. Setup the SQL database. In this project, PostgreSQL on [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) and put the details in the `.env` file.

3. Migrate the database models using:
`python3 manage.py migrate`

4. Create a superuser with your own credentials:
`python3 manage.py createsuperuser`

5. Run the Django sever:
`python manage.py runserver`
The address of the server will appear in the terminal window.
Add /admin to the address to access the Django admin panel using your superuser credentials.

### Heroku Deployment

Sign up to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) for free if you don't already have an account.

1. Create a new app in Heroku.

2. In the Resources tab of your app in the Heroku dashboard, click Add-Ons and select Heroku Postgres. Select Hobby Dev - Free as your plan.

3. When Heroku Postgres is installed, click the Settings tab in the Heroku Dashboard.
Click Reveal Config Vars, and add the same variables from your `.env` file here, except for `DEBUG`, as you don't want debug mode on the deployed project.

4. Insert the `SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL` and `CLOUDINARY_URL` to the Config Vars. 

5. Create a file called `Procfile` (no extension) containing the following:
```
web: gunicorn mentool.wsgi
```

6. Add the url of your Heroku app ('https://mentool-2af96fd6f7e7.herokuapp.com') to your `settings.py` file:

```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
    'https://mentool-2af96fd6f7e7.herokuapp.com',...
]
```

7. Disable collect static so that Heroku doesn't try to collect static files when you deploy by adding the following to your Heroku Config Vars in the Settings tab of Heroku dashboard:

```
DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1
```

The same variable has to be removed from Heroku Config Vars when you want to collect static files (for the testing and final deployment).

8. Stage and commit your files to GitHub
```
git add . 
git commit -m "Commit message"
git push
```

9. In the Heroku dashboard for your App, select Deploy.
Under Deployment Method, choose GitHub and search for your repository and click Connect.

10. Select Enable Automatic Deployments, and then Deploy Branch. Heroku will build the App from the branch you selected.

11. Now whenever you push your commits to GitHub, Heroku will rebuild the application.

### Forking the GitHub Repository
